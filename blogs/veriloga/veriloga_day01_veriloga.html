<h3>What is PPA optimization ? </h3>
<p>RTL designers who write HDL code to design a circuit do not only have to fulfill the functional verification, the designer needs to meet the specifications given by Vendors of 3 respective metrics : Performance, Power and Area (PPA) !</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Performance</strong> - Maximum operating frequency capacity of the chip (i.e. DUT for FPGA) (This is the most critical spec)</li>
  <li><strong>Power</strong> - Consume minimal dynamic and static power</li>
  <li><strong>Area</strong> - Take the least area on the given chip area (i.e in terms of FPGA: least amount of Logic and memory resources such as LUT, FF, etc)</li>
</ul>

    <h2>In this blog we show an example of PPA optimization of RTL design on FPGA</h2>
    <p>Let us take an RTL design of an unsupervised learning engine that implements spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) training from a brain-inspired neuromorphic AI accelerator designed by <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313866" target="_blank">Liu et al. (2019)</a>. The details of the STDP learning rule and how the learning engine design functions is explained in this blog  <a href="https://aaryanvdhawan.github.io/posts/2025/07/optimizing-an-stdp-learning-engine-for-fpgas/" target="_blank"> STDP learning engine</a>. </p>
    
    <h3>A Brief Intro to STDP</h3>
    <p>Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) is a learning rule inspired by how the human brain works. It changes the weight strength between a pair of neurons based on when they fire. If the presynaptic neuron fires just before the next layer postsynaptic one, the connection gets stronger. But if it fires after, the connection becomes weaker. This helps spiking neural networks (SNNs) learn patterns that happen over time, similar to how our brain processes information. 
      Because of this, STDP is useful in building energy-efficient on-chip trainable AI-computing systems for things like real-time learning, robotics, and edge devices.</p>

  <p><em>Block-level RTL diagram of STDP learning logic integrated into a neuromorphic accelerator</em></p>
  
<p> Since the function of the circuit was explained in details in the <a href="https://aaryanvdhawan.github.io/posts/2025/07/optimizing-an-stdp-learning-engine-for-fpgas/" target="_blank"> blog </a> mentioned before, we are only going to focus how can a simple PPA optimization be done for such a circuit. The SystemVerilog RTL code of the entire learning engine architecture along with it's testbench has been attached to this repository <a href="https://github.com/muhammadfarhan720/STDP_learning_engine" target="_blank"> link </a>.</p>
  
    <h2>Inspection steps for PPA optimization on FPGA</h2>
    <p>Here are the sequential steps how we should inspect an existing design for PPA optimization : </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Performance means the maximum operating clock frequency that the design can run. It determines design's processing speed and generally the most important spec that must be met as provided by the Vendor. We can find out the approximate maximum operating frequency \(F_{max}\) from the Vivado timing report. Let us check the screenshot from the implementation timing report of the current learning engine design in the following :
    <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muhammadfarhan720/web-profile/master/files/veriloga/veriloga_day01/Vivado_basic_LE_timing.PNG" target="_blank">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muhammadfarhan720/web-profile/master/files/veriloga/veriloga_day01/Vivado_basic_LE_timing.PNG" 
         alt="Vivado Timing Report - Implementation" 
         style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; display: block; margin-bottom: 20px;margin-top: 10px;">
  </a>
  <p>Here the Fmax is approximated by using the equation  \(F_{\text{max}} \approx \frac{1000}{T_{\text{clock}} - \text{WNS_Setup}}\)=187.23 MHz in MHz where we used \({T_{\text{clock}\)=10ns as the base system clock was chosen 100 MHz.</p>
  Now the maximum clock frequency or \(F_{max}\) of a design spec mainly depends upon the longest delay path i.e. critical path from the design. 
          
    <p>We can express the \( F_{\text{max}} \) using the timing components of a typical synchronous digital design as follows:</p>

$$
F_{\text{max}} = \frac{1}{
T_{\text{clk-q}} + T_{\text{logic}} + T_{\text{routing}} + T_{\text{setup}} - T_{\text{skew}}
}
$$
<p>Assuming  \( T_{\text{skew}} \)=0 and grouping the other delay terms  into a single critical path delay \( T_{\text{critical-path}} \) , we can rewrite the equation as:</p>

          $$
F_{\text{max}} = \frac{1}{
T_{\text{critical-path}} }
$$
Now let us analyze the critical path of this design using the Vivado Timing Summary. The screenshot below highlights the setup timing, which is the most critical delay component in synchronous designs.     
          
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muhammadfarhan720/web-profile/master/files/veriloga/veriloga_day01/criticalpath_scr.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muhammadfarhan720/web-profile/master/files/veriloga/veriloga_day01/criticalpath_scr.jpg" 
       alt="Critical Path Timing Screenshot" 
       style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; display: block; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 20px;">
</a>

According to the report, the longest datapath delay—measured at 5.393 ns—spans from the input port (counter index) to the priority encoder logic. Reducing this critical path delay will result in increasing the maximum operating frequency, enabling the circuit to operate with higher processing speed.

</a>
          </li>

      
      <li><strong>Area</strong> In general perspective,  Area refers to the amount of hardware resources consumed by RTL implementation on the target FPGA device. Specifically, for FPGA area measuring, we analyze the major component counts such as LUT, FF/Registers, BRAM and DSP blocks. Now let us have a look at our current resource usage from Vivado utilization report :
      <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muhammadfarhan720/web-profile/master/files/veriloga/veriloga_day01/util_scr.jpg" target="_blank">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muhammadfarhan720/web-profile/master/files/veriloga/veriloga_day01/util_scr.jpg" 
       alt="Vivado Utilization Report Screenshot" 
       style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; display: block; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 20px;">
</a>

<p>From the report, we observe that the design utilizes <strong>179 LUTs</strong> and <strong>347 flip-flops</strong>, which are the primary contributors to logic resource usage in this implementation of the STDP learning engine since no BRAM or DSP are being used.</p>
      </li>
      
        <li><strong>Power</strong>  Power optimization in FPGA design aims to reduce both <em>dynamic</em> and <em>static</em> power consumption while maintaining required performance and functionality. The power consumed due to switching activitiy within the programmable logic blocks and their interconnect is referred mainly as dynamic power whereas the power consumed due to leakage current  </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Imagine This...</h3>
    <p>Picture yourself in a lab, surrounded by oscilloscopes and circuit boards. You have an idea for a new analog filter. Instead of reaching for your soldering iron, you sit down at your computer and write a few lines of Verilog-A. Suddenly, your concept transforms into a dynamic model that you can simulate. The thrill of creation without the mess!</p>
    
    <h2>Getting Started with Verilog-A</h2>
    <p>Ready to dive in? Here’s a simple example to get you started:</p>

  
    <pre><code> 
    `include "discipline.h" // Include Verilog-A libraries
    `include "constants.h"  // Include fundamental constants
    
    module simple_resistor (p, n); // Module definition for a resistor with nodes p and n
        electrical p, n; // Declare electrical nodes p and n
        parameter real R = 1k; // Resistor value set to 1k ohms
    
        analog begin // Analog block for behavior definition
            I(p, n) <+ V(p, n) / R; // Current defined by Ohm's Law: I = V/R
        end
    endmodule // End of simple_resistor module
    </code></pre>

  
    <p>In this snippet, we define a simple resistor module. It captures the essence of Ohm’s Law in just a few lines—simple, right?</p>
